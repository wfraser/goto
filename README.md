# `goto` ‚Äì Working Directory Shortcuts

You open a terminal window, and get to work. But first you need to change directories. If you work on a large project, you probably end up doing that a few times before you‚Äôre close to the thing you‚Äôre working on.


    $ cd projects/current_project/src/com/example/thing/components
    # aw shoot, what was it called again?
    $ ls
    ... lots of stuff ...
    $ cd frobnicator
    $ ls
    ... more stuff ...
    $ cd lib
    # etc.

Even if you remember exactly where it is in the tree you‚Äôre going, it‚Äôs a lot of typing, right?

 `cd ~/projects/current_project/src/com/example/thing/components/frobnicator/lib`

A common workaround is to set up a handful of `alias` -es in your `.bashrc` or other shell init script that go to commonly-used locations.

## Enter `goto` , a more flexible solution.

`goto`  is a context-sensitive set of shortcuts to your working directories. By context-sensitive, it means what it does depends on where your current directory is. You can configure a default working subdirectory (and any number of named alternates) for each of the projects you work on. Simply `cd` to anywhere in those projects, and type `goto` , and it brings you to that working directory.

### Configuration

`goto` is configured by a simple plain text file in your home directory, `~/.goto.toml` . It uses the TOML format to express structure in an easy-to-read way. (TOML is a lot like the well-known ‚ÄúINI‚Äù format, but better defined and more flexible.)

A sample:

    proj = "~/projects/current_project"
    dl = "~/downloads"
    pk = "~/packages"

    ["~/projects/current_project"]
    "*" = "src/com/example/thing/components/frobnicator/lib"
    comps = "src/com/example/thing/components"
    test = "tests/thing"

The top of the file defines a few named shortcuts. These are available from everywhere; simply `goto <name>` to invoke them.

The line in brackets begins a context. It‚Äôs only active when you‚Äôre in a subdirectory of the path given. It then defines some more shortcuts specific to that context. The `*` shortcut is special: it is the default, used when you don‚Äôt call `goto` with any arguments.

The paths inside the context can be given relative to the path of the context itself.

So in this case, a common flow might be:

    $ goto proj # or: cd projects/current_project
    $ goto comps
    $ ls
    $ cd <something>

A lot less typing.

### Advanced Configuration

Contexts can overlap too! `goto` matches contexts from the most precise one first, out to the global context. A more-specific context can name shortcuts the same as less-specific ones, and they will override them. So `goto test` could bring you to project-wide UI tests in a project-wide context, but inside some sub-component‚Äôs directory, it could be configured to bring you to that component‚Äôs unit tests instead.

## Installation

Requirements:

1. rust compiler
2. a Unix-based OS (Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, etc., but not Windows üòì)

To download, build, and install:

- `git clone https://github.com/wfraser/goto.git`
- `cd goto.git`
- `cargo build --release`
- `echo "function goto() { eval \$($(pwd)/target/release/goto \$*) }" >> ~/.bashrc`
- `. ~/.bashrc`

(adjust the last two lines as needed to suit your shell)

Note that `goto` is meant to be used with your shell‚Äôs `eval` function, because that‚Äôs the only way to change your shell‚Äôs current directory. It prints `pushd <directory>`, which the shell must evaluate itself.

## Future Plans
1. Currently `goto` is very Unix-centric. It would be nice to make a Powershell or `cmd.exe` compatible version.
2. ???
